A linear programming solver written in Rust. Currently, a basic solver based on the simplex method is implemented.

Ideas For Future Improvements
-----------------------------
* Improve solver, so it also solves the dual programs
* Easy to use Python interface
* Support standard formats like MPS, APML and GAMS
* Support artificial variables
* Implement integer programming (MIP) solver
